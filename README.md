### :seedling::bee::herb: The Garden Mole :sunflower:
is to become a super fancy garden management program, based on past garden info, lunar calendar, good-bad neighbour relationships etc.

The idea behind this work was inspired by my mother, who is addicted to gardening and spends all her free time making veggies feel at home in her back yard. 
Having an unexplainable passion for complicating things, she gathered infos about numerous different gardening styles and old planting wisdoms and decided to use ALL of them. This is my attempt at automating her garden planning.

Features to be included in planning the planting for a given garden:
- companion planting
- moon planting
- crop rotation
- required/wanted plants (and their minimal seeding space)
- etc.
